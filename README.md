🌟 About Me

I’m a passionate fullstack developer who enjoys building meaningful digital experiences. I’m especially interested in web and mobile development, with a strong focus on performance, usability, and modern UI design.
Currently, I’m sharpening my skills in full-stack development and exploring how different technologies work together to create scalable products.

My favorite programming languages are TypeScript, JavaScript, and Python, and I enjoy working with frameworks like Next.js and React Native.
Fun fact: I love optimizing things—whether it’s website performance, code structure, or developer workflows.

My development journey started with curiosity about how websites work, and it has grown into a continuous pursuit of learning, experimenting, and building real-world projects.

🎯 Current Focus

Learning: Advanced Next.js, performance optimization, and rust

Building: Personal web projects, experimental tool

Exploring: Rust, system-level programming, and better ways to combine frontend with backend services

Goals: Become a more well-rounded full-stack developer and ship polished, production-ready projects this year, also contributing to open source projects
