## 🌟 About Me

I’m a passionate **full-stack developer** who enjoys building meaningful digital experiences with a strong focus on **performance**, **usability**, and **modern UI design**.

I’m especially interested in **web and mobile development**, where I enjoy exploring how different technologies work together to create scalable, production-ready products.

My development journey started with simple curiosity about how websites work, and it has grown into a continuous pursuit of **learning, experimenting, and shipping real-world projects**.

**Fun fact:** I love optimizing things — whether it’s website performance, code structure, or developer workflows.
